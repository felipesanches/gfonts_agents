# Google Fonts Dashboard - Gemini CLI Context

## Project Overview

This project, the "Google Fonts Dashboard", is a web application designed to centralize and visualize information pertaining to Google Fonts' typographic font project repositories. It serves as a monitoring and reporting tool, providing insights into repository status, build processes, designer contributions, and overall project health.

**Purpose:** To aggregate and present data from various sources related to Google Fonts repositories, making it easier to track progress, identify issues, and understand the project's ecosystem.

**Technologies:**
*   **Frontend:** HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and vanilla CSS. The JavaScript handles dynamic content loading, data manipulation, and rendering of tables, charts, and interactive elements.
*   **Data Storage:** JSON files located in the `data/` directory serve as the primary data source for the frontend.
*   **Local Serving:** Python's built-in `http.server` module is used for local development.

**Architecture:** A static web application architecture. The frontend fetches and processes JSON data files, which are likely generated by separate Python scripts.

## Building and Running

### Local Development

To run the dashboard locally, use the provided shell script:

```bash
./run.sh
```

This command starts a local HTTP server using Python. By default, it will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`. You can specify an alternative port by passing it as an argument:

```bash
./run.sh 3000
```

### Deployment

The project is designed to be compatible with GitHub Pages for deployment.

### Data Generation

The `data/` directory contains JSON files that power the dashboard. These files are likely generated by Python scripts located in the `scripts/` directory (e.g., `audit_bios.py`, `classify_build_approaches.py`, `fetch_designers.py`).

**TODO:** Document the specific commands to generate or update these JSON data files.

## Development Conventions

### Version Control (Git)

*   **Commit Policy:** Commits should be made frequently, whenever any small progress is achieved. This practice keeps the commit history granular, making it easier to track changes, revert if necessary, and understand the project's evolution.

### Frontend Development

*   **JavaScript:** Primarily uses vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation, fetching data from JSON files, and dynamically rendering content. No specific JavaScript framework (like React, Vue, Angular) is detected.
*   **CSS:** Employs vanilla CSS for styling. The styles are well-organized, using modern layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid) and a consistent, modern visual theme with a color palette reminiscent of Google's Material Design. The CSS is responsive and structured to handle various components and data displays.

### Data Management

*   The project follows a data-driven approach, relying on structured JSON files for all its displayed information. This suggests a separation between data processing (likely handled by Python scripts) and data presentation (handled by frontend JavaScript).

### Code Organization

*   **Separation of Concerns:** The codebase adheres to a clear separation of concerns:
    *   `index.html`: Main structure.
    *   `css/`: Stylesheets.
    *   `js/`: Frontend JavaScript logic.
    *   `scripts/`: Python scripts for data generation and utility tasks.
    *   `data/`: JSON files containing processed data.
