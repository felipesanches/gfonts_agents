# Project Guidelines

## Context

The Google Fonts project stores binary font files (.ttf) in the `google/fonts` repository (https://github.com/google/fonts). Each of these files was at some point generated by a font engineer through a compilation process from source project files stored in upstream repositories.

### Terminology

- **google/fonts**: Refers to https://github.com/google/fonts - the main repository containing compiled font binaries
- **upstream repos**: Source repositories containing font project files (`.glyphs`, `.ufo`, `.designspace`, etc.) from which the binary fonts are compiled
- **METADATA.pb**: Protocol buffer files in google/fonts that document font metadata, including the `repository_url` field pointing to upstream repos

### Goals

1. **Primary goal**: Collect 100% of upstream repository URLs and document them in the corresponding `METADATA.pb` files
2. Verify that `repository_url` fields point to valid repositories
3. Verify that commit hashes in METADATA.pb exist in the upstream repos

## Language

All code, comments, documentation, and commit messages must be in English.

## Commit Policy

Make commits frequently, whenever any small progress is achieved. Keep commits granular and atomic.

## Tech Stack

- Static site (HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript)
- No build tools or frameworks
- Must be compatible with GitHub Pages

## Message Logging

All user messages must be logged to `data/message_log.json` with timestamp and verbatim content. Append new messages to the array as they are received.

## Development

Run locally with `./run.sh` (uses Python's http.server).
