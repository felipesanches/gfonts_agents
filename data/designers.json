Founded in 2002, the studio came together through a shared love of typography and design, a wish to expand and modernize the font industry as a whole, and the desire to make everyday use of type more accessible. They expanded from a modest design firm with dozens of their own typefaces into a boutique type foundry under the name Cadson Demak in 2008.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cadsondemak\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a> | <a href=\"https://x.com/cadsondemak\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>",
