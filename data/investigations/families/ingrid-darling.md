## Investigation

The METADATA.pb for Ingrid Darling (at `/mnt/shared/google/fonts/ofl/ingriddarling/METADATA.pb`) already contains a complete source block with `repository_url`, `commit`, and `config_yaml` fields.

The upstream repository is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/googlefonts/ingrid-darling/`. Verification confirmed:

1. **Commit hash**: `ea2b4893cf8dc8cd0e7fb2b89f9631b38fde4ed3` exists in the upstream repo. The commit message is "description file moved o documentation" authored by Viviana Monsalve on 2022-03-11. This is also the HEAD commit of the repository.

2. **Config file**: `sources/config.yml` exists and contains:
   ```yaml
   sources:
     - IngridDarling.glyphs
   familyName: "Ingrid Darling"
   buildVariable: false
   ```

3. **Source format**: The repository uses a `.glyphs` source file (`IngridDarling.glyphs`), which is gftools-builder compatible.

The font was designed by Robert Leuschke. The family was added to Google Fonts on 2022-03-11, matching the commit date exactly, suggesting this was the onboarding commit.

## Conclusion

The source block for Ingrid Darling is complete and verified. Repository URL, commit hash, and config_yaml all check out. No action needed.
