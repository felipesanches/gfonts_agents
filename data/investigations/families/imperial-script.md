## Investigation

The METADATA.pb for Imperial Script (at `/mnt/shared/google/fonts/ofl/imperialscript/METADATA.pb`) already contains a complete source block with `repository_url`, `commit`, and `config_yaml` fields.

The upstream repository is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/googlefonts/imperial-script/`. Verification confirmed:

1. **Commit hash**: `01a1656c6ffebe306262129aafee029fe6a7f3f3` exists in the upstream repo. The commit message is "v10 updated glyph info" authored by Viviana Monsalve on 2021-11-12. This is also the HEAD commit of the repository.

2. **Config file**: `sources/config.yml` exists at the referenced path and contains:
   ```yaml
   sources:
     - ImperialScript.glyphs
   familyName: "Imperial Script"
   buildVariable: false
   ```

3. **Source format**: The repository uses a `.glyphs` source file (`ImperialScript.glyphs`), which is gftools-builder compatible.

The font was designed by Robert Leuschke. The family was added to Google Fonts on 2021-11-18, shortly after the commit date (2021-11-12), consistent with the source metadata.

## Conclusion

The source block for Imperial Script is complete and verified. Repository URL, commit hash, and config_yaml all check out. No action needed.
