## Investigation

The METADATA.pb contains a source block with repository URL and commit hash. No `config_yaml` is set in METADATA.pb.

Bitcount Single is part of the initial batch of non-Ink Bitcount families added in January 2025. All non-Ink families were added at the same upstream commit `af0818eaeb3b0839806ea19134fc18f317cdcf5a`, confirmed by the google/fonts commit `bb009d354` body.

Commit `af0818eaeb3b` is confirmed valid in the upstream repo cache at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/petrvanblokland/TYPETR-Bitcount`, dated January 13, 2025.

The upstream `sources/config.yaml` only contains `familyName: Bitcount`. An override `config.yaml` is present in the google/fonts family directory (`ofl/bitcountsingle/config.yaml`):
```yaml
sources:
  - sources/Bitcount_Template.designspace
familyName: Bitcount Single
buildVariable: true
buildOTF: false
```

Per policy, since an override `config.yaml` exists in the google/fonts directory, the `config_yaml` field is correctly omitted from METADATA.pb.

## Conclusion

The METADATA.pb source block is complete. The commit `af0818eaeb3b0839806ea19134fc18f317cdcf5a` is confirmed as the onboarding commit. An override `config.yaml` is present in the google/fonts family directory. No action needed.
