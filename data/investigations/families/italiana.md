## Source Data (METADATA.pb)

```
No source block

## Investigation

The font is stored under `ofl/italiana/` with an OFL license. The METADATA.pb has no `source` block at all.

The font history in google/fonts shows:
- `90abd17b4` — "Initial commit" — the font was present from the very beginning of the google/fonts repository (2015)

The copyright states: "Copyright (c) 2011 by Santiago Orozco (hi@typemade.mx) with reserved name Italiana"

The FONTLOG.txt reveals:
- Designer: Santiago Orozco (hi@typemade.mx, www.typemade.mx, Twitter: @Typemade)
- Version 1.001 — Initial release on 11 March 2012
- The font was designed for use in newspaper and magazine headlines, inspired by Italian calligraphy masters

No GitHub repository has been identified for this font. The designer (Santiago Orozco / typemade.mx) appears to have submitted this font directly to Google Fonts. No cached upstream repository was found in `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/` for this family.

The font has only a regular weight (no italics or other variants), suggesting it may be a very early submission before version control workflows were established.

The font date_added is "2012-03-14" and has never been updated in google/fonts since the initial commit.

## Conclusion

No upstream repository is known for this font. The font was contributed directly to google/fonts by Santiago Orozco of typemade.mx. No GitHub repository has been found for this designer's work on Italiana specifically.

Action needed: Contact Santiago Orozco (hi@typemade.mx / @Typemade) to determine if source files are available and whether there is a repository for this font. If no upstream repo exists or can be created, document as `missing_url`.
