## How URL Found

The URL was confirmed through PR #3916 ("Corinthia: Version 1.013; ttfautohint (v1.8.3) added") by vv-monsalve, which explicitly states: "taken from the upstream repo https://github.com/googlefonts/corinthia".

## How Commit Determined

1. **METADATA.pb source block**: `commit: "9c81839655dfec773b737abc90cb09ac94b1bea1"`
2. **google/fonts commit message** (51050e9d1): "Corinthia Version 1.013; ttfautohint (v1.8.3) taken from the upstream repo https://github.com/googlefonts/corinthia at commit https://github.com/googlefonts/corinthia/commit/9c81839655dfec773b737abc90cb09ac94b1bea1"
3. **PR #3916 body**: Same explicit reference to the commit

```yaml

This is a valid gftools-builder config. No override config.yaml exists in the google/fonts family directory.
