- **Date added**: 2024-08-12

## Source Block Status

**Already has source block**: Yes (complete with repository_url, commit, archive_url, files, branch, config_yaml)

## Upstream Repository

- **Repository URL**: https://github.com/SorkinType/VICWANTSchoolhandAustralia
- **Cached at**: upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/SorkinType/VICWANTSchoolhandAustralia
- **Repository status**: Clean, up to date with origin
- **Source files**: `sources/AuVICWANT.glyphs` (single Glyphs source)
- **Config**: `sources/config.yaml` using `fontprimer` recipe provider
- **Shared repo**: This upstream repo serves ALL five Edu AU VIC WA NT family variants (Hand, Arrows, Dots, Guides, Pre). A single `.glyphs` source is built into multiple font families using the `variants` system in config.yaml.

## Config.yaml Analysis

The config.yaml uses `recipeProvider: fontprimer` with a `variants` system. The Guides variant is not explicitly listed among the named variants in config.yaml. Instead, it is generated by the `doGuidelines: true` flag in config.yaml, which instructs fontprimer to produce an additional "Guides" variant automatically.

## Commit Hash Analysis

### Current METADATA.pb commit
- **Commit**: `6529c525fceb9ec15e51dfa6d87244ef053c2d8a`
- **Date**: 2024-12-04
- **Author**: Eben Sorkin
- **Message**: "corrected positions for lcaron, dcaron, tcaron and Lcaron in the various styles required for cursive and other stylistic varients"

### Important: Repo history was squashed
The upstream repo currently has only ONE commit (`6529c52`), dated 2024-12-04. All previous history was squashed into this single commit. The old commit hashes still exist as GitHub tags but are no longer reachable from any branch:

- **v1.000** tag -> `abab94d19985f24132e45db4c4822b042eb63302` (initial release, 2024-03-19)
- **v1.001** tag -> `88099a2e2d47e222cb62441730a2bc1c082754e1` (2024-04-30)
- **v1.002** tag -> `4d4efe710065410b34b66fa9d588498351642f41` (2024-10-11)

### Onboarding History in google/fonts

1. **Initial onboarding**: Commit `72283941` (2024-08-13, Simon Cozens) "Edu VIC WA NT Guides: Version 1.001 added". This commit added the font with commit hash `abab94d1` (v1.000 tag) and archive_url pointing to the v1.000 release. No explicit upstream commit reference in the commit message body. Merged via PR #8021 on 2024-08-20 by Viviana Monsalve.

2. **Display name update**: Commit `8715b340` updated the `display_name` in METADATA.pb.

3. **Batch update**: Commit `19cdcec5` (2025-03-31, Felipe Sanches) as part of "[Batch 1/4] port info from fontc_crater targets list" changed the commit hash from `abab94d1` (v1.000) to `6529c52` (current HEAD) and added `config_yaml: "sources/config.yaml"`.

### Archive URL inconsistency

The METADATA.pb currently references commit `6529c52` (post-squash HEAD) but the `archive_url` still points to the v1.000 release. The font binary in google/fonts was onboarded from the v1.000 release and was never updated.

### Commit hash accuracy concern

The original onboarding used commit `abab94d1` (tag v1.000). The batch update changed this to `6529c52` (post-squash HEAD). Since the repo was force-pushed to squash history, `6529c52` is the only reachable commit.

## Verification Summary

| Field | Value | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| repository_url | https://github.com/SorkinType/VICWANTSchoolhandAustralia | Correct |
| commit | 6529c525fceb9ec15e51dfa6d87244ef053c2d8a | Acceptable (post-squash HEAD; original was abab94d1 / v1.000) |
| config_yaml | sources/config.yaml | Correct (exists in repo) |
| archive_url | v1.000 release | Correct for the onboarded binary |
| branch | main | Correct |

## Status

- **Status**: complete
- **Confidence**: HIGH
- **Notes**: Source block is fully populated. The commit hash `6529c52` is the only commit in the (squashed) repo. The archive_url points to v1.000 which matches the binary originally onboarded. The config.yaml uses `fontprimer` recipe provider. No action needed.
