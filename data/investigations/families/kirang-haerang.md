No source block

## Investigation

The METADATA.pb for Kirang Haerang has no `source` block. The font was added on March 13, 2018 via commit `16680f868` ("korean families r01: added (#1459)").

The copyright notice reads: "Copyright 2018 The Kirang Haerang Project Authors"

The designer is credited as "Woowahan Brothers" in METADATA.pb. The font was added as part of a batch of Korean fonts in PR #1459.

No upstream GitHub repository was found in the cache. The "Woowahan Brothers" organization is a Korean software company. No `config.yaml` or source files have been identified.

The git history shows a later fix: `c6f978399` ("Hotfixed space & nbspace chars"), suggesting some post-onboarding maintenance was done directly in google/fonts.

## Conclusion

The font is a Korean display font from 2018 with no tracked upstream repository. This family needs further investigation to identify the source repository, likely from the Woowahan Brothers organization or through the PR #1459 history for additional context.
