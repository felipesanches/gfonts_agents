## Config YAML Status

**config.yaml exists** in the upstream repository at `sources/config.yaml`. Contents:
```yaml
sources:
  - CoralPixels.glyphs
familyName: "Coral Pixels"
outputDir: ../fonts
ttDir: $outputDir/ttf
buildTTF: true
buildOTF: false
```

The source file is `sources/CoralPixels.glyphs` (Glyphs format), which is fully compatible with gftools-builder. The `config_yaml` field in METADATA.pb correctly points to `sources/config.yaml`.

## Verification

- **Repository accessible**: Yes (verified via git remote URL)
- **Commit hash valid**: Yes - matches the only commit in the repo, and explicitly referenced in onboarding commit
- **Source block complete**: Yes - has repository_url, commit, config_yaml, files mapping, and branch
- **Config.yaml valid**: Yes - properly configured for gftools-builder with Glyphs source

## Confidence Level

**High** - Modern onboarding with explicit commit reference in the google/fonts commit message. Complete source block in METADATA.pb. Single commit in upstream repo makes the hash unambiguous.

## Open Questions

None. This family is fully complete with all source documentation in place.
