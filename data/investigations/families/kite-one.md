## Investigation

The METADATA.pb contains `repository_url` and `commit`. The upstream repository `etunni/Kite-One` is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/etunni/Kite-One`.

The repository contains a Glyphs source file at `sources/Kite One.glyphs`. No `config.yaml` exists in the upstream repository. However, `google/fonts/ofl/kiteone/config.yaml` provides an override:

```yaml
buildVariable: false
sources:
  - sources/Kite One.glyphs
```

The latest commit in the upstream cache is `be1d4f2` ("Merge pull request #1 from emmamarichal/master"), which matches exactly the commit hash in METADATA.pb.

Since there is no `config_yaml` field in METADATA.pb but there is an override `config.yaml` in the google/fonts family directory, google-fonts-sources will auto-detect the local override.

## Conclusion

Status is complete. The source block has repo URL and commit hash. An override `config.yaml` exists in the google/fonts directory. No changes needed to METADATA.pb.
