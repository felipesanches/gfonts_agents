## Summary

Geist is a sans-serif variable font by Vercel (designers: Andres Briganti, Mateo Zaragoza, and others). It was onboarded to Google Fonts on 2024-10-24 via PR #8246 by Viviana Monsalve. Both Geist and Geist Mono share the same upstream repository (`vercel/geist-font`) and the same onboarding commit. The METADATA.pb already has a complete source block with repository URL, commit hash, config.yaml path, archive URL, and file mappings. This family is fully documented.
