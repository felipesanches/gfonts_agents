## Investigation Details

### 1. METADATA.pb Analysis

The current METADATA.pb has a complete source block:

```
source {
  repository_url: "https://github.com/vercel/geist-font"
  commit: "b193ef74010119759bfb7f71ddf81a3dee238535"
  config_yaml: "sources/config-GeistMono.yaml"
  archive_url: "https://github.com/vercel/geist-font/releases/download/1.4.01/GeistMono-1.4.01.zip"
  files {
    source_file: "variable/GeistMono[wght].ttf"
    dest_file: "GeistMono[wght].ttf"
  }
  branch: "main"
}
```

All fields are populated. The `config_yaml` field was added in commit `cbe1f7ee5` (2025-04-03) by Felipe Sanches, alongside the same addition for Geist.

   - Added `config_yaml` field to METADATA.pb source block

### 3. Upstream Repository (Shared with Geist)

Geist Mono shares the upstream repository https://github.com/vercel/geist-font with the Geist sans-serif family. Both were onboarded from the same commit `b193ef74` (2024-10-23), which is a merge commit "Merge pull request #141 from vercel/139-fixes".

The repository contains separate source files and config files for each family:
- Geist: `sources/Geist.glyphspackage` + `sources/config-Geist.yaml`
- Geist Mono: `sources/GeistMono.glyphspackage` + `sources/config-GeistMono.yaml`

### 4. Source Files at Referenced Commit

At commit `b193ef74`, the Geist Mono sources consist of:
- `sources/GeistMono.glyphspackage` (Glyphs 3 package format)
- `sources/config-GeistMono.yaml` (gftools-builder config)

### 5. Config YAML

The `sources/config-GeistMono.yaml` at the referenced commit configures:
- Source: `GeistMono.glyphspackage`
- Output directory: `../fonts/GeistMono`
- Family name: "Geist Mono"
- Autohint OTF: true
- STAT table with weight axis (100-900) and italic axis

### 6. Repository Cache

The upstream repo is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/vercel/geist-font/` (shared with Geist).

### 7. Relationship to Geist

Both Geist and Geist Mono:
- Share the same upstream repository (`vercel/geist-font`)
- Were onboarded from the same commit (`b193ef74`)
- Were onboarded on the same day (2024-10-23) by the same person (Viviana Monsalve)
- Resolve the same issue (#6922)
- Were merged via adjacent PRs (#8246 for Geist, #8264 for Geist Mono)
- Had their `config_yaml` fields added in the same commit (`cbe1f7ee5`)

## Conclusion

Geist Mono has a fully complete source block in METADATA.pb. The repository URL, commit hash, config.yaml path, archive URL, and file mappings are all correct and verified. No changes are needed.

### Current METADATA.pb Source Block (already correct)
