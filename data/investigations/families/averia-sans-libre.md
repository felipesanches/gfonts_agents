## How the Repository URL Was Found

No repository URL is documented in the METADATA.pb (there is no `source { }` block). The designer Dan Sayers (i@iotic.com) has a GitHub account (IOTic) with only one unrelated repo (traccar-client-android). No font source repositories were found.

A legacy `librefonts/averiasanslibre` repo exists in the upstream cache with only TTX (decompiled font) files and no editable source files. The `src/` directory contains only `METADATA_comments.txt` and `VERSIONS.txt`.

A `Tookmund/fonts-averia-sans` repo exists on GitHub, but it is a Debian font packaging repo, not an upstream source repository.

GitHub searches for "averiasanslibre", "averia-sans-libre", and "averia sans libre font" yielded no relevant source repositories.

The Averia project website at http://iotic.com/averia/ provides ZIP downloads of the font files. The page describes the creation process as algorithmically averaging all fonts on the creator's computer using FontForge. The "Libre" variants specifically average the OFL-licensed fonts from Google Web Fonts (as of November 9, 2011).

## How the Commit Hash Was Identified

N/A -- No upstream repository with original sources exists.

The last TTF-modifying commit in google/fonts is `0f81bc904` ("hotfix-averiasanslibre: v1.002 added", PR #838, by m4rc1e, merged 2017-08-07). The PR body was empty. All 6 font files were modified in this hotfix. The font was originally added in the initial commit `90abd17b4` of the google/fonts repo.

The METADATA.pb has additional `stroke: "SANS_SERIF"` and `classifications: "DISPLAY"` fields, added by commit `1db714082` ("The last batch of ~250 updated METADATA.pb files for stroke and classification"), which was a metadata-only update.

## How Config YAML Was Resolved

No `config.yaml` exists anywhere. The librefonts/averiasanslibre repo has no build-compatible source files. The google/fonts family directory contains only the 6 binary TTFs, DESCRIPTION, FONTLOG, METADATA.pb, and OFL.txt.

Averia Sans Libre is a 6-style family (Light, LightItalic, Regular, Italic, Bold, BoldItalic), all algorithmically generated.

## Verification

- Commit exists in upstream repo: N/A
- Commit date: N/A
- Commit message: N/A
- Source files at commit: None -- no proper upstream repo exists

## Confidence

**High**: There is high confidence that no proper upstream repository with build-compatible sources exists. All three Averia Libre families (Averia Libre, Averia Gruesa Libre, Averia Sans Libre) share the same situation -- they were algorithmically generated by Dan Sayers, who has no font source repositories on GitHub. The librefonts mirrors contain only decomposed TTX files without editable sources.

## Open Questions

1. Does Dan Sayers still have the FontForge source files (.sfd) or the averaging scripts used to generate the Averia fonts? Contact: i@iotic.com
2. All three Averia Libre families (plus Averia Serif Libre) share the same origin story -- should they be investigated/resolved together as a group?
3. Should these families be classified as "no rebuildable source" given their unique algorithmic origin, where the "source" is an averaging script rather than traditional font design files?
