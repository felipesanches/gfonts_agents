## Source Data (METADATA.pb)

```
source {
  repository_url: "https://github.com/itfoundry/khand"
}
primary_script: "Deva"
```

## Investigation

The METADATA.pb contains `repository_url` but no `commit` or `config_yaml`. The upstream repository `itfoundry/khand` is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/itfoundry/khand`.

The repository uses the same custom build system as Karma (Indian Type Foundry's Python-based tool). The `masters/` directory contains:
- `Khand_0.ufo` and `Khand_0.vfb` (FontLab)
- `Khand_1.ufo` and `Khand_1.vfb` (FontLab)

The build process uses `build.py` with ITF's custom `itf.py` scripts. No `config.yaml` exists in the repository.

The last upstream commit is `1f1d677` ("Compile 2.000"), dated November 21, 2014. The google/fonts commit history shows updates: `21bb9bd12` ("hotfix-khand: v1.101 added (#899)") and `2f26ba721` ("Corrected outlines of Iacute and Igrave (#5507)"). The hotfix was around May 2017.

## Conclusion

The source block needs a `commit` field. The commit to use is likely `1f1d677` ("Compile 2.000" from Nov 2014) or an earlier version corresponding to the initial onboarding. No `config.yaml` is possible as the repository uses ITF's custom build system (Python scripts with FontLab/UFO sources).
