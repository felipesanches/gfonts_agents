## Source Data (METADATA.pb)

```
source {
  repository_url: "https://github.com/theleagueof/league-script-number-one"
}
```

## Investigation

The METADATA.pb has a `repository_url` pointing to `https://github.com/theleagueof/league-script-number-one` but no commit hash.

The google/fonts git history for `ofl/leaguescript/LeagueScript-Regular.ttf` shows:
- `17eecaf5f` — "ofl/leaguescript: v1.001 added. Fixed name table OS X validation failure."
- `90abd17b4` — "Initial commit" (earliest onboarding)

The upstream repo at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/theleagueof/league-script-number-one/` contains:
- `LeagueScriptNumberOne.otf` — prebuilt OTF
- `source/LeagueScriptNumberOne.ufo` — UFO source
- `source/LeagueScriptNumberOne.vfb` — FontLab VFB source
- `source/LeagueScriptNumberOne.bak`

The repo has a single commit: `225add0` ("Initial commit with readme and licenses"). There is no `config.yaml` for gftools-builder.

Since the repo has only one commit, that commit is the most likely candidate for the onboarding reference, though no explicit reference was found in the google/fonts commit messages.

## Conclusion

The repository URL is present but the commit hash is missing. The upstream repo has only one commit (`225add0`), which is likely the reference commit. The sources include UFO format which could support an override `config.yaml`, but the VFB file is the primary design source (FontLab format).
