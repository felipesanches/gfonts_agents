## Investigation

The font was added to google/fonts in commit `245758c4d` ("Inspiration: Version 2.010; ttfautohint (v1.8.3) added (#4114)"). The commit body confirms the source:

> Inspiration Version 2.010; ttfautohint (v1.8.3) taken from the upstream repo https://github.com/googlefonts/inspiration at commit https://github.com/googlefonts/inspiration/commit/629ca27262fbcc6cfe745bd95d2e7b72a8e3b047.

The upstream repository is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/googlefonts/inspiration`. The commit `629ca27262` was verified to exist in the cache. The log shows this commit was created on 2021-11-26 with message "v2.010 glyphs info updated".

**Source format**: The repository contains `sources/InspirationPro.glyphs` (a single Glyphs source file). There is **no `config.yaml`** in the upstream repository itself.

However, an override `config.yaml` exists in the google/fonts family directory at `ofl/inspiration/config.yaml` with content:
```yaml
buildVariable: false
sources:
  - sources/InspirationPro.glyphs
```

Per policy, when an override `config.yaml` exists locally, the `config_yaml` field in METADATA.pb is not needed. The current METADATA.pb does not set `config_yaml`, which is correct.

The commit hash in METADATA.pb (`629ca27262`) matches the onboarding commit confirmed in the gftools-packager message. This is verified against the cached repo.

## Conclusion

The source block is complete and correct. The `repository_url` and `commit` are verified. An override `config.yaml` exists in the google/fonts directory. No changes needed.
