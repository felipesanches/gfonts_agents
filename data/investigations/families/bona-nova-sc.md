## Investigation

Bona Nova SC is the small caps variant of Bona Nova, added to Google Fonts on 2024-05-27. It shares the same upstream repository as Bona Nova.

### Git History

The font TTF files were added by google/fonts commit `e92080ad6` (2024-05-27, author: Simon Cozens):

```
Bona Nova SC: Version 4.001; ttfautohint (v1.8.4.7-5d5b) added

Taken from the upstream repo https://github.com/kosmynkab/Bona-Nova at commit
https://github.com/kosmynkab/Bona-Nova/commit/a5cbdfb8741af20ea5bfe252f0128beed6c8beed.
```

This documents the upstream repo and commit hash, which is the same as Bona Nova. A subsequent commit `19cdcec59` (2025-03-31, "[Batch 1/4] port info from fontc_crater targets list") added the `config_yaml: "sources/config.yaml"` field.

### Upstream Repository

The repo is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/kosmynkab/Bona-Nova/`. The `sources/config.yaml` exists at commit `a5cbdfb8` and contains:

```yaml
sources:
  - BonaNova.glyphs
  - BonaNova-Italic.glyphs
familyName: Bona Nova
buildVariable: False
```

However, the METADATA.pb `files {}` entries reference `fonts/ttf/BonaNovaSC-Regular.ttf`, `fonts/ttf/BonaNovaSC-Bold.ttf`, and `fonts/ttf/BonaNovaSC-Italic.ttf` — but these SC TTF files do **not** exist in the upstream repository at any point in its history. Only the non-SC TTFs (`BonaNova-Regular.ttf`, `BonaNova-Bold.ttf`, `BonaNova-Italic.ttf`) are present.

Furthermore, the `sources/config.yaml` specifies `familyName: Bona Nova` and builds only the non-SC variant. It does not define a build target for the SC variant.

The SC fonts were most likely generated by Simon Cozens using a separate build process (activating small caps features from the Glyphs sources) and submitted as pre-built binaries during the PR.

### Verification

- Repository URL: Confirmed correct (stated in commit message)
- Commit hash: Confirmed — `a5cbdfb8` exists in upstream repo as HEAD of main
- Config YAML: `sources/config.yaml` exists but does NOT build the SC variant
- METADATA.pb files entries: Reference SC TTF paths that do not exist in the upstream repo
- No separate SC build config exists in the upstream repo or as an override in google/fonts

## Conclusion

The repository URL and commit hash are correctly recorded. However, the `config_yaml` field (`sources/config.yaml`) does not build the SC variant — it builds the regular Bona Nova family — and the `files {}` entries reference TTF paths that do not exist in the upstream repository. This is a documentation issue rather than a data integrity problem: the fonts were built by Simon Cozens from the same Glyphs sources using a small caps build pipeline, but no config reflecting that process exists. The `config_yaml` field should be reviewed and potentially corrected or removed.
