## Investigation

The METADATA.pb contains `repository_url`, `commit`, and `config_yaml` fields. The upstream repository `sovichet/kdam-thmor-pro` is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/sovichet/kdam-thmor-pro`.

The `sources/config.yaml` file exists in the cached repository. The latest commit is `02b97ee` ("Merge pull request #10 from sovichet/dependabot/pip/certifi-2023.7.22"), which matches exactly the commit hash in METADATA.pb.

The source block is fully populated with all required fields.

## Conclusion

Status is complete. No changes needed. The METADATA.pb source block is fully populated with repository URL, commit hash, and config_yaml path.
