## Investigation

The METADATA.pb contains `repository_url`, `commit`, and `config_yaml` fields. The upstream repository `ronykoch/Karantina` is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/ronykoch/Karantina`.

The `Sources/config.yaml` file exists in the cached repository along with `Sources/karantina.glyphs`. The latest commit in the upstream cache is `efb7e92` ("Add files via upload"), which matches exactly the commit hash in METADATA.pb (only one commit exists in the repo).

The source block is fully populated with all required fields.

## Conclusion

Status is complete. No changes needed. The METADATA.pb source block is fully populated with repository URL, commit hash, and config_yaml path.
