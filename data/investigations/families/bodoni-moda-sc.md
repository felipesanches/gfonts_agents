## Investigation

Bodoni Moda SC is the small caps variant of Bodoni Moda, added to Google Fonts on 2024-05-27. It shares the same upstream repository as Bodoni Moda.

### Git History

The font files were added by google/fonts commit `c910e0d6c` (2024-05-27, author: Simon Cozens):

```
Bodoni Moda SC: Version 2.005 added

Taken from the upstream repo https://github.com/indestructible-type/Bodoni at commit
https://github.com/indestructible-type/Bodoni/commit/30ce6cdc354ef179a3b72ba0f0e71826e599348c.
```

This documents the upstream repo and commit hash matching the main Bodoni Moda family. A subsequent commit `19cdcec59` (2025-03-31, "[Batch 1/4] port info from fontc_crater targets list") added the `config_yaml: "sources/config.yaml"` field.

### Upstream Repository

The repo is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/indestructible-type/Bodoni/`. Commit `30ce6cdc` is the HEAD of master.

The `sources/config.yaml` exists at this commit but defines builds only for the non-SC variant (`BodoniModa[opsz,wght].ttf` and `BodoniModa-Italic[opsz,wght].ttf`) with `familyName: Bodoni Moda`. It does NOT define a build target for the SC variant.

Furthermore, the METADATA.pb `files {}` entries reference `fonts/variable/BodoniModaSC[opsz,wght].ttf` and `fonts/variable/BodoniModaSC-Italic[opsz,wght].ttf`, but these files do **not** exist in the upstream repository at any commit in its history. Only the non-SC variable fonts are present in `fonts/variable/`.

The SC fonts were most likely generated by Simon Cozens through a separate build process (small caps extraction from the Glyphs sources) and submitted as pre-built binaries, not pulled directly from the upstream repo.

### Verification

- Repository URL: Correct, confirmed by commit message
- Commit hash: Correct (same commit as Bodoni Moda, exists in upstream repo)
- Config YAML: `sources/config.yaml` exists but does NOT build the SC variant
- METADATA.pb files entries: Reference non-existent paths in the upstream repo (`BodoniModaSC[opsz,wght].ttf` not present)
- No separate SC build config exists in the upstream repo or as an override in google/fonts

## Conclusion

The source block has repository_url and commit hash correctly set, but the `config_yaml` field (`sources/config.yaml`) does not actually build the SC variant — it builds the regular Bodoni Moda family. The referenced binary files in the `files {}` entries also do not exist at those paths in the upstream repo. A separate build process (or separate config.yaml) would be needed to properly document how the SC variant is built. The `config_yaml` field should likely be removed or corrected, and the issue should be raised with Owen Earl or Simon Cozens to clarify the SC build process.
