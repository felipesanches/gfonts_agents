## Methodology

### Repository URL
Documented in METADATA.pb `source.repository_url` and confirmed by the copyright string ("The Big Shoulders Project Authors (https://github.com/xotypeco/big_shoulders)"). All Big Shoulders variants share the same upstream repository.

### Commit Hash
The commit `0b3d09a86862b19efae28eae0cd868f17c476b20` was recorded in the METADATA.pb when the family was first added to Google Fonts. The add commit `4617763385` in google/fonts explicitly states: "Taken from the upstream repo https://github.com/xotypeco/big_shoulders at commit 0b3d09a86862b19efae28eae0cd868f17c476b20."

Verification:
- Commit `0b3d09a` exists in the upstream repo, dated 2024-02-26, with message "regenerate font files"
- The source file `Big-Shoulders/sources/BigShoulders.glyphs` exists at this commit
- The SC variant binary (`BigShouldersTextSC[wght].ttf`) does NOT exist as a pre-built file in upstream at this commit -- it is generated by gftools-builder using the override config.yaml
- The override config.yaml builds the SC variant by applying `smcp -> ccmp` remap to the base Text font

This family was added in May 2024 by Simon Cozens, not as an update of an existing family but as a **new addition** to Google Fonts. The SC (Small Caps) variant is derived from the base Big Shoulders source.

### Config YAML
An override `config.yaml` exists in the google/fonts family directory at `ofl/bigshoulderstextsc/config.yaml`. However, the actual build configuration is in `ofl/bigshoulderstext/config.yaml` which builds both BigShouldersText and BigShouldersTextSC. The Text SC config.yaml appears to be a copy.

The build recipe:
1. Builds from `Big-Shoulders/sources/BigShoulders.glyphs`
2. Subspaces to `opsz=10` (text optical size)
3. Applies `smcp -> ccmp` remap for Small Caps
4. Renames to "Big Shoulders Text SC"

Since the override config.yaml exists in google/fonts, the `config_yaml` field is correctly omitted from METADATA.pb.

### google/fonts history
- `6466fe7e8`: "Update OFL.txt"
- `1b3950469`: "Update DESCRIPTION.en_us.html"
- `43b8ff234`: "Add SC line to description"
- `461776338` (2024-05-30): "Big Shoulders Text SC: Version 2.002 added" -- references `0b3d09a`

### Author and provenance
- Added by Simon Cozens (2024-05-30), same batch as other Big Shoulders SC variants
- Override config.yaml also added in same commit

### Upstream repo cache
- Cached at: `xotypeco/big_shoulders`
- Commit `0b3d09a86862b19efae28eae0cd868f17c476b20` verified ("regenerate font files", 2024-02-26)
- Source `Big-Shoulders/sources/BigShoulders.glyphs` exists at this commit
- No pre-built `BigShouldersTextSC[wght].ttf` at this commit (SC is built via override config)

## Confidence

**High**: The commit was explicitly referenced in the google/fonts add commit, the source .glyphs file exists at that commit, and this was a straightforward new-family addition by Simon Cozens.

## Notes
- Part of the Big Shoulders superfamily (all in https://github.com/xotypeco/big_shoulders)
- New family added 2024-05-30 (not an update of a pre-existing family)
- SC variant is generated via override config.yaml (smcp -> ccmp remap), not from a pre-existing binary
- The source_file path in METADATA.pb for the font binary is a build OUTPUT path, not a pre-existing upstream file
- Same batch addition as Big Shoulders Stencil Text SC, Big Shoulders Display SC, etc.
- The override config.yaml at `ofl/bigshoulderstextsc/config.yaml` mirrors the one at `ofl/bigshoulderstext/config.yaml` (both build Text and Text SC variants)
