## Investigation

The METADATA.pb has `repository_url`, `commit` hash, and `archive_url` pointing to the v4.400 release. The commit `d682ea7cc0305b592058255167c83d059aa640fa` was verified to exist in the upstream repo at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/silnrsi/font-lateef/`:

```
commit d682ea7cc0305b592058255167c83d059aa640fa
Author: Lorna Evans <LornaSIL@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Mon Aug 11 16:00:30 2025 -0500

    Regenerate ftml files. [nobuild]
```

The google/fonts commit (`e73610035`) was made on 2025-09-05 and its body states: "Lateef: Version 4.400 added. Taken from the upstream repo https://github.com/silnrsi/font-lateef at commit https://github.com/silnrsi/font-lateef/commit/d682ea7cc0305b592058255167c83d059aa640fa."

The `v4.400` tag in the upstream points to commit `934a8399` ("Finalize documentation", Aug 2025). The commit `d682ea7cc` is a `[nobuild]` commit that came after the v4.400 tag but before the v4.401 bump. The packager used this as the HEAD reference commit while the actual fonts came from the archive_url.

The upstream repo at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/silnrsi/font-lateef/` uses `.designspace` sources in `source/` and does not have a `config.yaml` file.

## Conclusion

Commit hash, repository URL, and archive URL are all present. The commit `d682ea7cc` is a `[nobuild]` commit that is the HEAD of the repo at the time of the v4.400 release packaging. No `config.yaml` exists in the upstream repo; the sources use `.designspace` format with SIL's own build toolchain.
