## Investigation

The METADATA.pb has `repository_url`, `commit` hash, and `config_yaml` all populated. The commit `20491885ca2cf7ffc556432973e7bdbc701952b5` is the same commit used for all Lexend families and was verified to exist in the upstream repo at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/googlefonts/lexend/`.

The `sources/mega.yaml` config file exists in the upstream repo.

All Lexend family variants share the same upstream repo and commit hash, with commit `beda156f5` in google/fonts confirming the reference.

## Conclusion

All source metadata fields are complete and verified. No action needed.
