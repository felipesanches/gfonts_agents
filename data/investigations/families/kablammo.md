## Investigation

The METADATA.pb for Kablammo has a complete source block with `repository_url`, `commit`, `files`, `branch`, and `config_yaml`. The upstream repository is `https://github.com/Vectro-Type-Foundry/kablammo`, a variable font with a `MORF` axis.

The commit hash `cccc120d23cbf65f7f263122407d980a24f65f27` was verified to exist in the cached repository at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/Vectro-Type-Foundry/kablammo/`. The `sources/config.yml` file (note: `.yml` extension, not `.yaml`) exists at this commit and contains a valid gftools-builder configuration:

```yaml
sources:
  - Kablammo.glyphs
buildOTF: True
buildTTF: False
axisOrder:
  - MORF
familyName: "Kablammo"
```

The `config_yaml` field in METADATA.pb correctly points to `sources/config.yml` in the upstream repo. Note that the extension is `.yml` (not `.yaml`), which is correctly reflected in the METADATA.pb.

The copyright string confirms the repository: "Copyright 2023 The Kablammo Project Authors (https://github.com/Vectro-Type-Foundry/kablammo)".

Kablammo also has a minisite at `https://fonts.withgoogle.com/kablammo`.

## Conclusion

Kablammo is in a complete state. The METADATA.pb has `repository_url`, `commit`, and `config_yaml` (pointing to `sources/config.yml` in the upstream repo) all correctly set. The config file exists at the referenced commit. No action needed.
