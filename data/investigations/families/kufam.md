## Investigation

The METADATA.pb contains `repository_url` but no `commit` or `config_yaml`. The upstream repository `originaltype/kufam` is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/originaltype/kufam`.

The font was onboarded on July 22, 2020 via commit `7cc3227ee` ("Added Kufam 1.300 (#2552)"). The DESCRIPTION.en_us.html added in that commit references `github.com/originaltype/kufam`.

The upstream repository contains Glyphs source files in the `sources/` directory:
- `sources/Kufam_Arabic_Latin_Roman_Master.glyphs`
- `sources/Kufam_Latin_Italic_Master.glyphs`
- `sources/build.sh`

No `config.yaml` exists in the repository. The build uses a custom shell script (`build.sh`).

The likely onboarding commit is `49b96562` ("Merge pull request #9 from yanone/master", July 17, 2020) which was "Version 1.300 ready for Google Fonts". This is the latest upstream commit before the Google Fonts onboarding date of July 22, 2020.

## Conclusion

The `commit` field needs to be added to the METADATA.pb source block. The most likely candidate is `49b96562` (the v1.300 release PR merge). The Glyphs sources exist but no `config.yaml` - an override config.yaml could be created in google/fonts. This needs further confirmation of the exact commit hash and creation of a config.yaml.
