## How the Repository URL Was Found
Baskervville SC shares the same upstream repository as Baskervville: `https://github.com/anrt-type/ANRT-Baskervville`. The Small Caps variant is built from the same Glyphs source using `buildSmallCap: true` in the config.yaml. The copyright string confirms: "Copyright 2018 The Baskervville Project Authors (https://github.com/anrt-type/ANRT-Baskervville)". The google/fonts commit fe282bb64 (2025-04-23) states: "Taken from the upstream repo https://github.com/anrt-type/ANRT-Baskervville".

## How the Commit Hash Was Identified
The commit hash `0629447774568fd957d98736487afb000be38b55` is recorded in METADATA.pb. The google/fonts commit fe282bb64 for "Baskervville SC: Version 1.100 added" explicitly confirms: "at commit https://github.com/anrt-type/ANRT-Baskervville/commit/0629447774568fd957d98736487afb000be38b55". This is the same commit used for the Baskervville family, which makes sense since both are generated from the same sources.

Note: The SC font binary was subsequently updated in commit 72f3e5c3 (2025-05-01) by Emma Marichal to "update fonts with the right OFL url", but this was a metadata fix in the binary, not a new upstream build.

## How Config YAML Was Resolved
The config file `sources/config.yaml` exists in the upstream repo at the referenced commit. The `buildSmallCap: true` directive in the config is what generates the BaskervvilleSC variant:
```yaml
sources:
    - Baskervville.glyphs
    - Baskervville-Italic.glyphs
familyName: Baskervville
autohintOTF: false
buildSmallCap: true
```

No override config.yaml exists in the google/fonts family directory.

## Verification
- Commit exists in upstream repo: Yes
- Commit date: 2025-04-22 11:33:01 +0200
- Commit message: "rebuilt fonts with SC"
- Source files at commit: `sources/Baskervville.glyphs`, `sources/Baskervville-Italic.glyphs`, `sources/config.yaml`
- SC font file at commit: `fonts/variable/BaskervvilleSC[wght].ttf`

## Note on Upstream Changes
Same as Baskervville: 2 commits exist after the referenced commit (`75cbd68` and `35a86a0`), which would need separate review.

## Confidence
**High**: The commit hash is explicitly confirmed by the google/fonts packager commit message, the upstream repo is the same as Baskervville, and the SC variant is generated by the `buildSmallCap: true` setting in config.yaml.

## Open Questions
None
