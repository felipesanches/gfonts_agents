## Source Data (METADATA.pb)

```
source {
  repository_url: "https://github.com/Omnibus-Type/Jaldi"
  commit: "13315457c7dd2cadd03642a2edd9d9552d0c227f"
  config_yaml: "sources/config.yaml"
}
```

## Investigation

The METADATA.pb already contains a complete source block with repository URL, commit hash, and config_yaml path.

Git history in google/fonts shows four commits touching this font:
- `1f3895e6b` — "jaldi: Updating to v1.007" (latest update, no upstream reference)
- `8640d2357` — "Updating Jaldi"
- `6385bf319` — "Updating Jaldi"
- `90abd17b4` — "Initial commit" (original onboarding)

The METADATA.pb was updated through several commits:
- `21e98aac8` — "More upstreams (i,j,k)" — added the `repository_url` field
- `19cdcec59` — "[Batch 1/4] port info from fontc_crater targets list" — added `commit` and `config_yaml` fields, sourced from fontc_crater's target.json (commit `ee7a65d433882450efa1d8418ed746bf07c05642` in fontc_crater repo)
- `cc250c972` — added `primary_script` field

The fontc_crater batch commit added commit hash `13315457c7dd2cadd03642a2edd9d9552d0c227f` and config_yaml `sources/config.yaml`.

The upstream repository `Omnibus-Type/Jaldi` is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/Omnibus-Type/Jaldi`. Commit `13315457c7dd2cadd03642a2edd9d9552d0c227f` exists in the repo — it is the "Update README.md" commit by Yorlmar Campos, dated 2021-04-14. This commit is likely not the exact onboarding commit for the current font binary (the latest binary update via "jaldi: Updating to v1.007" doesn't reference a specific upstream commit), but it was the best available reference when the fontc_crater data was compiled.

The file `sources/config.yaml` exists in the upstream repo and is valid.

## Conclusion

The source block in METADATA.pb is complete with all fields present. The commit hash `13315457c7dd2cadd03642a2edd9d9552d0c227f` comes from the fontc_crater targets list and is verified to exist in the upstream repo. Note that the most recent binary update ("jaldi: Updating to v1.007") did not record an upstream commit, so there may be a newer relevant commit in the upstream. However, the current data is the best available and no correction is needed at this time.
