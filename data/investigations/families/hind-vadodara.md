# Investigation Report: Hind Vadodara

## Summary

Hind Vadodara is a Gujarati sans-serif font family by Indian Type Foundry, added to Google Fonts on 2015-09-09. The font was onboarded and then updated in a v1.001 hotfix in PR #894 (May 2017) by Marc Foley. The upstream repository at `itfoundry/hind-vadodara` is confirmed and has had no commits since October 2015. The upstream repo uses `hindkit` (a custom Python build tool), not gftools-builder, and has no `config.yaml`. An override `config.yaml` already exists in the google/fonts family directory.

## Investigation Details

### METADATA.pb Analysis

The METADATA.pb already contains the correct `repository_url` (`https://github.com/itfoundry/hind-vadodara`) in the source block. No commit hash is recorded. No `config_yaml` field is set, which is correct since an override config.yaml exists locally.

### Git History in google/fonts

The TTF files in `ofl/hindvadodara/` were modified in these commits (most recent first):

1. **`076e12e9b`** (2017-05-08) - "hotfix-hindvadodara: v1.001 added (#894)" by Marc Foley - This is the last commit that modified the binary TTF files. PR body was empty.
2. **`eb75f9f49`** - "hindvadodara: New Gujuarti family" - Original onboarding.

A deploy commit `76adaf1d2` (2021-11-01) also touched the TTFs but this was a mass deployment, not a source-based update.

### Upstream Repository Analysis

The upstream repo at `itfoundry/hind-vadodara` is cached at `upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/itfoundry/hind-vadodara/`. It has 24 total commits on a single branch (`master`).

**Latest commit**: `d1972e4` (2015-10-17) - "Compile 1.000" by Liang Hai. No commits have been made after this date. Unlike hind-siliguri, this repo does not have a merge commit at the top; the "Compile 1.000" commit is directly on master.

**Build system**: The repo uses `hindkit`, a custom Python build tool (via `build.py`). The build script is nearly identical to hind-siliguri's, calling `hindkit` functions to compile from the `.glyphs` master file. This is NOT compatible with gftools-builder.

**Source files**:
- `masters/HindVadodara.glyphs` - The main source file
- `features/` - Feature files
- `build/` - Contains pre-compiled OTF outputs (not TTFs)

**Build outputs**: The upstream repo only contains OTF builds in `build/`, not TTFs. The v1.001 TTFs in google/fonts were generated by Marc Foley, likely by rebuilding from the same sources with a TTF output target.

### Commit Hash Determination

The upstream repo's last commit (`d1972e4`, Oct 17 2015) predates the v1.001 hotfix (May 8 2017) and no additional commits were made afterward. `d1972e4` is the correct commit hash. This is the HEAD of master and represents the final state of the v1.000 sources from which Marc Foley generated the v1.001 TTFs.

### Override config.yaml

An override `config.yaml` already exists in `ofl/hindvadodara/config.yaml` in google/fonts (added in commit `5ddf312e6`, Feb 2026):

```yaml
sources:
  - masters/HindVadodara.glyphs
```

This references the `.glyphs` source file relative to the upstream repo root. Since the override exists, the `config_yaml` field is correctly omitted from METADATA.pb.

## Conclusion

**Status: complete** - The repository URL is correct. The commit hash should be `d1972e4ebebc3a65feef2f66823a83444469ece4` (the latest and final commit in the upstream repo). An override config.yaml is already in place. The only missing piece in METADATA.pb is the commit hash.
