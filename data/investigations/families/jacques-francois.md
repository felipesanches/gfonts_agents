## Source Data (METADATA.pb)

```
source {
  repository_url: "https://github.com/cyrealtype/Jacques-Francois"
}
```

## Investigation

The METADATA.pb contains a `repository_url` but no `commit` hash and no `config_yaml` field.

Git history in google/fonts shows the font was added in the initial commit (`90abd17b4` — "Initial commit"), which predates the gftools-packager era. No commit hash information was recorded at that time.

The METADATA.pb was subsequently updated in commits:
- `21e98aac8` — "More upstreams (i,j,k)" — this added the `repository_url` field
- Various other commits for language metadata, stroke classifications, etc.

The upstream repository `cyrealtype/Jacques-Francois` is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/cyrealtype/Jacques-Francois`. The repo has 6 commits total, with the latest being `d341563` ("regenerated fonts v1.100"). The upstream does NOT have a `config.yaml` file anywhere in the repository — sources consist only of a `.glyphs` file at `sources/JacquesFrancois.glyphs`.

An override `config.yaml` already exists in the google/fonts family directory at `ofl/jacquesfrancois/config.yaml`, added in commit `5ddf312e6` ("Add config_yaml enrichment for 82 font families"). Its contents are:

```yaml
sources:
  - sources/JacquesFrancois.glyphs
```

Since an override `config.yaml` exists in google/fonts, the `config_yaml` field is intentionally omitted from METADATA.pb (the google-fonts-sources tool auto-detects local overrides).

The font in google/fonts has been there since the initial commit in 2012. The upstream repo shows a version 1.100 regeneration as the latest change. The exact commit used for the original onboarding cannot be determined from commit messages alone, as the onboarding predates gftools-packager.

## Conclusion

The `repository_url` is present and correct. The `config_yaml` field is correctly absent (local override exists). The only missing piece is the `commit` hash. Since this family was onboarded before gftools-packager, the original commit cannot be reliably determined without comparing binary files. The commit hash needs investigation to identify which upstream commit corresponds to the font currently in google/fonts.
