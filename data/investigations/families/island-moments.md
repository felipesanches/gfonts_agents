## Investigation

The font was added to google/fonts in commit `4eeaeee72` ("Island Moments: Version 1.010 added (#4085)"). The commit body confirms:

> Island Moments Version 1.010 taken from the upstream repo https://github.com/googlefonts/island-moments at commit https://github.com/googlefonts/island-moments/commit/665d59f297c782358f09699fc2231c0eee293f25.

The upstream repository is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/googlefonts/island-moments`. The commit `665d59f297c782358f09699fc2231c0eee293f25` was verified to exist in the cached repo. The repo has **only one commit** (2021-11-11, "sample image updated") which matches the METADATA.pb.

**Source format**: The repository contains `sources/IslandMomentsPro.glyphs` (a single Glyphs source file). A `config.yml` exists at `sources/config.yml`:
```yaml
sources:
  - IslandMomentsPro.glyphs
familyName: "Island Moments"
buildVariable: false
autohintTTF: false
```

The `config_yaml: "sources/config.yml"` in METADATA.pb is correctly set and the file exists in the upstream repo.

## Conclusion

The source block is complete and correct. The `repository_url`, `commit`, and `config_yaml` are all verified. The commit `665d59f` is the only commit in the repository and matches METADATA.pb exactly. No changes needed.
