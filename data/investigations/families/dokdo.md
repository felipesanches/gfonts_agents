## Investigation Details

### Onboarding History

Dokdo was added to Google Fonts in PR #1459 ("korean families r01: added") by Marc Foley on 2018-03-13 (commit `16680f868`). The PR body states: "Korean Font binaries have been mastered by Aaron Bell, https://www.sajatypeworks.com". This was a batch addition of Korean fonts.

The font binary has not been updated since onboarding.

### Upstream Repository Search

- No GitHub repository found for "Dokdo font" or "FONTRIX"
- FONTRIX appears to be a Korean foundry that contributed the font under OFL
- The copyright states "Copyright (c) 2005-2017 FONTRIX. All Rights Reserved."
- No upstream repo is cached in fontc_crater_cache
- Dokdo is the only family in the Google Fonts catalog attributed to FONTRIX

### Source Availability

No source files (`.glyphs`, `.ufo`, `.designspace`, `.sfd`) are publicly available. Only the compiled TTF binary exists in google/fonts.

## Conclusion

Dokdo has no known upstream repository. The font was provided as a compiled binary by FONTRIX for the Korean fonts batch addition. Without an upstream repo, no config.yaml can be set up and the font cannot be rebuilt from sources via gftools-builder.
