## Investigation

The METADATA.pb has both `repository_url` and `commit` hash, with explicit file mappings. The commit `82c844e60ab055cef1169f7825bc119ea3bd5090` was verified to exist in the upstream repo at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/typeland/Langar/`:

```
commit 82c844e60ab055cef1169f7825bc119ea3bd5090
Author: Alessia Mazzarella <>
Date:   Thu Nov 26 12:13:08 2020 +0000

    Updated Test Docs
```

The google/fonts history shows:
- `eff7e984b` — "Langar: Version 1.001; ttfautohint (v1.8.3) added (#2838)"

The file mappings reference `Fonts/TTF/Langar-Regular.ttf`, suggesting the upstream repo distributes prebuilt TTF files rather than using gftools-builder sources. No `config.yaml` was found in the upstream repo.

## Conclusion

Commit hash and repository URL are both present and verified. The upstream repo provides prebuilt TTF binaries, and no `config.yaml` is present. The explicit file mapping in METADATA.pb suggests this was onboarded using gftools-packager in file-copy mode rather than a build pipeline.
