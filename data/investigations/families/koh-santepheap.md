## Investigation

The METADATA.pb contains `repository_url`, `commit`, and `config_yaml` fields. The upstream repository `danhhong/KohSantepheap` is cached at `/mnt/shared/upstream_repos/fontc_crater_cache/danhhong/KohSantepheap`.

The `Source/builder.yaml` file exists in the cached repository with gftools-builder compatible content:
```yaml
sources:
  - KohSantepheap.glyphs
outputDir: "../Release"
buildStatic: true
buildVariable: false
```

The latest commit in the upstream cache is `316be94` ("Merge pull request #4 from yanone/master"), which matches exactly the commit hash in METADATA.pb.

The source block is fully populated with all required fields. Note: this font uses `builder.yaml` rather than the conventional `config.yaml` filename, but the format is the same gftools-builder configuration format.

## Conclusion

Status is complete. No changes needed. The METADATA.pb source block is fully populated with repository URL, commit hash, and config_yaml path (Source/builder.yaml).
